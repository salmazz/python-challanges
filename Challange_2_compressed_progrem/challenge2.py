# Challenge 2: Creating Zip Files with Python GUI
#
# Introduction:
# In this challenge, you will create a Python program that utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) to create zip archives from selected files. This program will allow users to select multiple files and generate a compressed zip file containing the chosen files.
#
# Program Overview:
# Your program will use the PySimpleGUI library to create a user-friendly GUI. Users will be able to select files that they want to include in the zip archive. The program will then compress these files into a zip file with a customizable name.
#
# Steps to Complete:
#
# Import Required Modules:
# Import the necessary modules, including zipfile for zip file manipulation and PySimpleGUI for creating the GUI.
#
# Create the GUI:
#
# Use PySimpleGUI to design a GUI window that allows users to select files for archiving.
# Display a text label to guide users and an input box to show the selected files.
# File Selection:
#
# Implement a file selection mechanism that enables users to choose multiple files they want to include in the zip archive.
# Display the selected files in the input box.
# Archive Creation:
#
# Provide a button to initiate the creation of the zip archive.
# Create a function that takes the selected filepaths and destination directory as input.
# Generate a specialized name for the zip file based on the names of the selected files.
# Use the zipfile.ZipFile class to create a zip archive with the chosen filepaths.
# Display Result:
#
# Inform users when the zip archive has been successfully created.
# Display the path to the generated zip file.
# Conclusion:
# By completing this challenge, you will have built a Python program with a graphical user interface that enables users to select files and create zip archives easily. This program showcases your skills in file manipulation, graphical user interface design, and user-friendly application development.
